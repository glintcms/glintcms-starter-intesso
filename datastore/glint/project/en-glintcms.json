  "text": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Motivation to build GlintCMS was the frustration we had while developing Real Time Systems as well as more &quot;Static&quot; Platforms, that need to be rendered on the server side for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We switched between different technologies and monolyts, until we decided to build small modules, that we can reuse for web applications as well as for web sites.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It turned into a modular and flexible solution, that leaves you enough room for custom solutions&nbsp;for small to medium Web Sites.</p>\n\n<p>It basically has no backend, but intuitive inline editing. It can run stuff on the server as well as in the browser.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Use Cases</h2>\n\n<p>- Web Application (Single Page Applications)</p>\n\n<p>- Web Sites / Platforms (Heavy server side rendering)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Development Principle</h2>\n\n<p>GlintCMS follows the GlintAPP principle:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/glintapp/glintapp\">github.com/glintapp/glintapp</a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Technology</h2>\n\n<p>- Server: node.js / express or connect</p>\n\n<p>- Browser: huge lib support with&nbsp;browserify</p>\n\n<p>- Extendability: with &quot;glint-*&quot; npm modules</p>\n\n<p>- Data Store: supports almost everything with mimimal effort</p>\n\n<p>- Templating: supports everything that renders in node.js as well as in the browser</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.glintcms.com\">www.glintcms.com</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/glintcms\">www.github.com/glintcms</a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
